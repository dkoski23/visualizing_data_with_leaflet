# visualizing_data_with_leaflet

This project pulls in earthquake GeoJSON data from USGS and visualizes them using leaflet. It also uses javascript, css, and html to do so while using d3 to read in the data. The index.html contains all of the scripts and links necessary to implement the code and link up with the proper files that make up the repository (I will note I did not include my actual API key in the config.js file). A map object is created as well as a tile layer before the specifications for coloration and the radius of the cirle visualized for each earthquake dependent on magnitude and radius. The GeoJSON data is then added to the map with the specified gradiation and colors, which completes the visualization.
